**Course Reflection**

What were your initial expectations for the course? Did the course meet,
exceed, or fall short of these expectations?

-	My initial expectations from this subject were to know more about the duties of a System administrator and to connect things that we learned on Server administration last semester. The course exceeds my expectations because I thought there is not coding but it turns out it’s a bit harder because we used cli command for short period of time.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What were the main topics or concepts covered in the course? How did
these topics contribute to your understanding of the subject matter?

-	The main topics it covers were evolution of systems administration, Linux and windows, end-user license agreement (EULA), web server monitoring, data recovery plan, acceptable use policy (AUP), capacity management and planning, and RAID levels. 
-	These helped me to understand further our topic through doing and exercising these activities. By doing so, we can learn lots of things especially in doing backups to important details, understanding EULA which is also essential to know what we are agreeing to. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reflecting on your learning process, what were the most effective
strategies or techniques that helped you grasp and retain the course
material?

-	One of the most effective strategies helped me to grasp the lesson is through group study and collaboration. Most of the time, I could not understand how to implement a certain task, for example in the VM where we use ubuntu, sometimes I am the last one to do the task related to it but by asking help, I can finally finish my task. 
-	In our laboratory, some people can grasp on how to simulate the activities while some of us – like me cannot easily do so, that is why when we have time, we do group study to lessen the time of asking when not necessary.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Were there any particular assignments, projects, or activities that
significantly enhanced your learning experience? Why were they
effective?

-	The most significant learning activity we ever did is creating our own EULA and creating capacity management planning where we design a network that must be scalable. These activities are effective because these will make you really think critically because it is like preparing you for a real job as well as in practicing or improving these skills can be highly beneficial when in the future industry especially, if it is new. You will be the one to design scalable and network and if it also involves business, you can implement the EULA.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Did you encounter any challenges or difficulties during the course? How
did you overcome these obstacles, and what did you learn from them?

-	One of the challenges is using PowerShell and ubuntu. Especially, during the prelims exam where we only have limited knowledge or commands and we do not know how to implement those commands. As well as some of the laboratory exercises.
-	What I did to overcome those is that I search basic commands to cli and tried at home. And at laboratory task, I ask my seatmate what to do because we were copying similar task provided yet I am not successfully implementing it and it turns out, I just missed 1 step / 1 command something like that. So, asking help can be beneficial except for quizzes and exams of course.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Did the course encourage critical thinking and analysis? How did it promote higher-order thinking skills, such as problem-solving or decision-making?
  
-	Yes. Because the task we are doing is a bit hard and you need to think on how to solve task. For example, in creating a capacity management and planning, we need to think what is efficient yet scalable networks. This task involves 2 skills namely problem-solving and decision-making. We will be needing to decide which one is better for it to be scalable. As well as the other laboratory task wherein even if you read websites, sometimes you need to decide what to do.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reflecting on your personal growth, what new knowledge, skills, or
perspectives did you gain from this course?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-	I learned a lot of skills that can be helpful in my future career but one of the most important things I realized in this course out of many skills is that trial-and-error. I actually do not like this because it wastes a lot of time but without it, we cannot understand and fully know which one works well for it. 
-	Also, I learned problem-solving and analyzation skills. One of the quotes I read somewhere that have great impact is “If I were to solve a world problem in an hour, I will define the problem for 55 minutes and give solutions in just 5 minutes.” -  so, before doing task, first I understand carefully the problem or the task before providing an answer. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How do you plan to apply what you have learned in this course to your
future studies, career, or personal life?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- I can apply the knowledge I have acquired by always have backups to your
important files, so if ever it might compromise, atleast we still have 
the files with us. We sometimes forget to backup but in this course we 
-	I'll use what I've learnt from this course in my future studies and personal life by defining a problem first before making a decision that can solve related problems, data backup, and frequently learning related topics. While in future career, I will apply the things I have learned here like data recovery planning, data protection, and data back using RAID levels. Because a primary goal is to protect data and systems so it is important to understand and implement these things in order to save the company.
